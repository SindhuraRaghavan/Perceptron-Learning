#Perceptron Learning Algorithm

##Implementation
```
The Perceptron Learning Algorithm (PLA) is a supervised ML algorith and a linear classifier of data points (x,y) where x is the input features and y is the label/classification class

The goal of training is to determine the model parameter w given the training data of input parameters and target labels

For all training samples (x,y):
    h(x) = w' * x
    If h(x) >= threshold, then h = 1; Else h = 0
    If h = y, classify x; Else, misclassify x

Do until there are misclassified data points or maximum number of iterations:
    Pick a random misclassified point
    Update w <- w + y * x

w after convergence or maximum number of iterations is the model parameter learnt during the training process

##Dataset
```
More about the Dataset : cleve_heart_disease.txt
* The complete dataset consists of 76 attributes
* We are interested in only 14 attributes of the 76 - Age, Sex, Chest pain type, Resting blood pressure, Cholesteral level, Fasting blood sugar, Resting ECG, Maximum heart rate, Angina, Oldpeak, Slope, Colored vessels, Thal, Healthy/sick* We discretize the input attributes 
* We discretize the attributes in the dataset as follows:
